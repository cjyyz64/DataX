postgresqlreader.1=The [fetchSize] you configured contains errors. The value of [fetchSize]: [{0}] cannot be less than 1 according to DataX design.
postgresqlreader.2=[Note]: You havenâ€™t configured a splitting primary key [splitPk] for PostgreSQLReader, DataX will split the task according to the number of tables. The number of tasks split by DataX is {0}, less than the number of channels you configured: {1}. Therefore, please take note that the actual concurrent channels of this synchronization task is: channel={2}.
postgresqlreader.3=[Note]: The splitting primary key [splitPk] you configured for PostgreSQLReader is: {0}. Due to of the too many repeated values in the splitting primary key, or the too few records in the source table, the number of tasks actually split by DataX is {1}, less than the number of channels you configured: {2}. Therefore, please take note that the actual concurrent channels of this synchronization task is: channel={3}.
